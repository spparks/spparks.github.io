What version of SPPARKS do you have? :h4,link(version)

A SPPARKS "version" is the date when it was released, such as 1 Sept
2010.  SPPARKS is updated continuously.  Every time we fix a bug or
add a feature, we release it immediately, as listed below.  Each dated
copy of SPPARKS contains all the features and bug-fixes up to and
including that version date.  The version date is printed to the
screen and logfile every time you run SPPARKS.  It is also in the file
src/version.h and in the SPPARKS directory name created when you
unpack a tarball.

If you browse the HTML or PDF doc pages on the SPPARKS WWW site, they
always describe the most current version of SPPARKS. :ulb,l

[27 Nov 2024]

This release has these new features and updates:

An enhancement to the AM Bezier model includes a variable heat affected
zone. This enhancement slightly changes the app input parameters to include a
tail parameter describing the variable HAZ. The app documentation and examples fully
explain the inputs and use of this app. See the "potts/am/bezier"_/doc/app_potts_am_bezier.html
application. :ulb,l

A new app named 'app/potts/quaternion' has been introduced. This app models
grain growth using cubic and hexagonal close-packed (HCP) crystal symmetries.
It utilizes quaternions to determine the relative orientation differences
between sites.  For more information, please refer to the examples in
examples/potts_quaternion and documentation
"potts/quaternion"_/doc/app_potts_quaternion.html application. :l

The Stitch library for SPPARKS has two updates: (1) Performance improvement: 
(10-100x) speedup when using the 'set stitch' command; (2) Discontinued use of
numpy.disutils. With this update, 'setuptools' are used to build the stitch
python extension; the stitch package no longer uses numpy.disutils. :l,ule

The following enhancements have been made for additive manufacturing
laser path generation in conjunction with the new Stitch library
added to SPPARKS:

Add a new "app_style potts/am/path/gen"_doc/app_potts_am_path_gen.html
command. This is a specialized additive manufacturing (AM)
application.  The app generates a sequence of computational volumes
(CV) which correspond with AM raster paths on rectangular domains; The
sequence of CVs generated are ordered according to the am build
specified; the union of CVs forms the final desired 3D rectangular
volume over which microstructures are simulated. :ulb,l
  
Add a new examples/stitch/stitching_rectangular_domain containing
an example demonstrating use of new app. :l
  
Minor bug fix in "app_style potts_weld"_doc/app_potts_weld.html
command relating to initialization of its random number generator. :l
  
Removed the am/potts/path/test app style. :l

Removed examples/am_path/cartesian_path_test. :l,ule

This new SPPARKS release has many additions useful for modeling
additive manufacturing (AM) microstructures.  John Mitchell (Sandia)
did the majority of the heavy lifting for this release.

The following commands have been added or modified; scripts using AM
commands prior to this release will need to be updated.

"am_build"_doc/am_build.html = new command
"am_path"_doc/am_path.html = new command
"am_path_layer"_doc/am_path_layer.html = new command
"am_pass"_doc/am_pass.html
"am_cartesian_layer"_doc/am_cartesian_layer.html :ul

The am_pattern and am_transverse_pass commands were removed, but
their functionality was replaced and enhanced with these 5 commands.

A new AM application was added, and the potts/additive app was enhanced:

"app_style potts/am/path/test"_doc/app_potts_am_path_test.html
"app_style potts/additive"_doc/app_potts_additive.html :ul

A new I/O system oriented towards additive manufacturing, called the
Stitch library, is included in this release.  The Stitch library reads
and writes snapshot files for large AM geometries and allow for each
lattice site in the large geoemtry to have multiple values, each with
a time stamp.  Thus the Stitch file can archive the state of a large
AM part at many points in time as it is manufactured.  A python module
for reading/writing Stitch files is also included which can be used
for visualization and analysis of simulated microstructures outside of
SPPARKS.  Stitch has been developed by John Mitchell and Jay Loftstead
(Sandia).

To use Stitch with SPPARKS you must build the Stitch library and
include the STITCH package before building SPPARKS.  The library
itself can be found in lib/stitch.  These files give information about
building and using Stitch with SPPARKS:

doc/Section_start.html
lib/stitch/README
examples/am_path/README
examples/stitch/README
examples/potts_additive :ul

Three SPPARKS commands now have options for using the Stitch library
and accessing Stitch files:

"set stitch"_doc/set.html = initialize sites from a Stitch file
"dump stitch"_doc/dump.html = write current site info to a Stitch file
"reset_time stitch"_doc/reset_time.html = reset time based on a Stitch file :ul

This is the "list of changed files"_patches/files.23Jul20.txt from the 18
May 2017 version.

:line

[18 May 2017]
 
John Mitchell (Sandia) added a new
"weld_shape_teardrop"_doc/weld_shape_teardrop.html command for use by
the "app_style potts/weld"_doc/app_potts_weld.html application.  It
allows the shape of the laser weld spot to be defined very generally.
Also see the "weld_shape_ellipse"_doc/weld_shape_ellipse.html command
for comparison.

Examples of using both are in the examples/potts_weld directory.

This is the "list of changed files"_patches/files.18May17.txt from the 17
May 2017 version.

:line

[17 May 2017]

This patch contains a new "app_style
potts/strain/pin"_doc/app_potts_strain_pin.html command written by
John Mitchell (Sandia).

Also a new "app_style potts/additive"_doc/app_potts_additive.html
command written by by Theron Rodgers and John Mitchell (Sandia).  It
can perform some sophisticated simulations of an additive
manufacturing (AM) process where a laser beam (heat source) is
rastered across a surface to induce grain growth.  The new application
uses several new commands:

"am_cartesian_layer"_doc/am_cartesian_layer.html
"am_pass"_doc/am_pass.html
"am_pattern"_doc/am_pattern.html
"am_transverse_pass"_doc/am_transverse_pass.html :ul

to specify the AM process.

See the examples/potts_additive directory for example scripts.

This is the "list of changed files"_patches/files.17May17.txt from the 23
Nov 2016 version.

:line

[23 Nov 2016]

Added some more input/output options to make it easier to use
SPPARKS in different workflows.

"dump_modify"_doc/dump_modify.html fileper and nfile and first options = write N dump files from P procs where 1 < N < P
new "dump sites"_doc/dump.html command = write out dump snapshots in read_sites format
new "dump vtk"_doc/dump.html command = write out dump snapshots in VTK format
read_sites option to read only specified per-site values :ul

The new "dump modify"_doc/dump_modify.html options can be useful when
running large problems on a large number P of processors, to allow
other choices besides 1 (huge) output file or P files.

The new "dump sites"_doc/dump.html style and
"read_sites"_doc/read_sites.html options mean that SPPARKS dump output
can be used directly by the read_sites command to continue or restart
a previous simulation.

The new "dump vtk"_dump.html style makes it easier to directly
visualize some kinds of SPPARKS output directly in VTK-compatible
visulizers, like "ParaView"_http://www.paraview.org.

This is the "list of changed files"_patches/files.23Nov16.txt from the 22
Nov 2016 version.

:line

[22 Nov 2016]

Added a "dump_modify sort"_doc/dump_modify.html command to enable
sorting of "dump"_doc/dump.html output within each snapshot by site
IDs or a chosen column of per-site information.  For parallel runs,
the sorting is done across all processors, which is not enabled by
default, since it requires extra memory and communication.

This is the "list of changed files"_patches/files.22Nov16.txt from the 5
Oct 2016 version.

:line

[5 Oct 2016]

Theron Rogers (Sandia) and collaborators have written a new "app_style
potts/weld/jom"_doc/app_potts_weld_jom.html command, which is similar
to the recently released "app_style potts/weld"_doc/app_potts_weld.html
command, but handles the geometry of the weld pool in a different manner.

This is the "list of changed files"_patches/files.5Oct16.txt from the 20
Sep 2016 version.

:line

[20 Sep 2016]

John Mitchell (Sandia) and collaborators have written a new "app_style
potts/weld"_doc/app_potts_weld.html command which can be used to
simulate the welding process to join two pieces of metal.  See the
examples/potts_weld directory for an example script.

This is the "list of changed files"_patches/files.20Sep16.txt from the 1

version.

This is the "list of changed files"_patches/files.26Feb16.txt from the 24
Feb 2016 version.

:line

[24 Feb 2016]

Added {cwrap} and {dwrap} keywords to the
"dump_modify"_doc/dump_modify.html command to allow very large
per-site color or diameter values to be wrapped into a smaller set of
color or size values when rendered by the "dump
image"_doc/dump_image.html command.  This allows, for example, 2
billion possible spin values to be drawn as one of 10000 colors,
instead of requiring memory allocation for 2 billion colors.

Also fixed a bug to allow the dump command to printing a 64-bit site
count (> 2B) correctly without integer overflow.

This is the "list of changed files"_patches/files.24Feb16.txt from the 1
Feb 2016 version.

:line

[1 Feb 2016]

Changes to enable 64-bit site IDs and thus to run problems with over
2^31 ~ 2 billion lattice sites.  There is now a -DSPPARKS_BIGBIG
compiler flag to enable building SPPARKS with support for the 64-bit
IDs.  See the "Section_start.html"_doc/Section_start.html doc page
for details.  SPPARKS now prints out its per-processor memory
footprint to assist in estimating how many MPI tasks you
need to run a large problem.

This is the "list of changed files"_patches/files.1Feb16.txt from the 11
Dec 2015 version.

:line

[11 Dec 2015]

Eric Homer (BYU) and Veena Tikare (Sandia) have written and added a
new hybrid Cahn-Hilliard phase-field plus Potts model as a new
"app_style potts/pfm"_doc/app_potts_pfm.html command for SPPARKS.  It
can be used to efficiently simulate grain growth in a two-phase system
controlled by diffusion.

See the doc page for more details on how to use it in SPPARKS, and for
a citation to their paper which gives a fuller explanation.

There is also an examples/potts_pfm dir with an example script and the
the "Pictures web page"_http://spparks.github.io/pictures.html now
has images of simulations performed with this command.

This is the "list of changed files"_patches/files.11Dec15.txt from the 21

[21 Oct 2015]

Updates to the new "app_style potts/grad"_doc/app_potts_grad.html
command.  There is now a examples/potts_grad dir with 3 examples of
how to use the application.  Some pictures and movies are on the
"Pictures"_http://spparks.github.io/pictures.html page of the web
site.

This is the "list of changed files"_patches/files.21Oct15.txt from the 8
Jul 2015 version.

:line

[8 Jul 2015]

Added a new on-lattice application, called "app_style
potts/grad"_doc/app_potts_grad.html.  It is a Potts model which allows
specification of linear gradients of temperature or mobility along a
given direction, which affects grain growth.

This is the "list of changed files"_patches/files.8Jul15.txt from the 18
Mar 2015 version.

[18 Nov 2013]

Have now allowed SPPARKS to be released (only in certain cases, by
request) under the LPGL (GNU Lesser General Public License).  Some doc
pages and README and LICENSE files were amended to state this.

This is the "list of changed files"_patches/files.18Nov13.txt from the 5
Nov 2013 version.

:line

[5 Nov 2013]

Made the initial random number seed used by each of the "solve
styles"_doc/solve_style.html depend on processor ID, so that each
solver generates a different random stream.  For many models this
isn't needed, but if you start a simulation with a homogeneous lattice
on every proc, you need more randomness to avoid correlations between
processors.

This is the "list of changed files"_patches/files.5Nov13.txt from the 7
Mar 2013 version.

:line

[7 Mar 2013]

Added a Python wrapper to SPPARKS, along with documentation for how to
build SPPARKS as a shared library, how to use the library interface,
and how to couple SPPARKS to other codes.  See new additions to the
manual in these sections:

"Section start"_doc/Section_start.html
"Section howto"_doc/Section_howto.html
"Section python"_doc/Section_python.html :ul

Also see these new directories in the distro:

python
examples/COUPLE :ul

The python dir has examples of Python scripts that invoke SPPARKS.
The COUPLE dir has an example of a coupled
SPPARKS/"LAMMPS"_https://www.lammps.org application using kinetic
Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics.  It also includes a small library
that does communication of data back-and-forth between the 2 codes.

Xiaowang Zhou (Sandia) ran into a bug with the
"create_sites"_doc/create_sites.html command when it was calculating
lattice connectivity with periodic lattices defined for simulation
boxes that were specified at arbitrary positions (not at the origin).
Due to a round-off issue, site-to-site connectitivy was sometimes
mixed up.  This patch should fix the problem.

Greg Ho (Lockheed Martin) identified a bug when lattice sites
(positions and neighbors) are read in thru a
"read_sites"_doc/read_sites.html command, as opposed to being
intialized thru a "create_sites"_doc/create_sites.html command and
just having their values setup via a read_sites file.  I believe this
bug was introduced by some of the changes to SPPARKS last fall.

Added a "boundary"_doc/boundary.html command to allow specification of
non-periodic boundaries in an on-lattice application.  This affects
the way sites are created and eliminates site neighbors across
non-periodic boundaries.  See the "create_sites"_doc/create_sites.html

"create_sites region"_doc/create_sites.html is now supported to only
create sites within a geometric region.

[18 Jul 2011]

Enhanced SPPARKS to be able to run arbitraryily large models with more
than 2 billions sites, limited only by the physical memory on your
machine.  This requires use of 64-bit integers to store site IDs and
various system tallies, like the number of accepted and rejected
events.

The data types for this are now defined in the file src/spktype.h,
which by default is set to allow for large problems.  To reduce memory
usage or for machines or MPI implementations that do not support
64-bit integers, you can revert to 32-bit integers by editing that
file.  See "this section of the manual"_doc/Section_start.html for
more details.

There is still a limit of around 2 billions sites per processor, which
should not be a restriction since that would have a huge memory
footprint to store neibhbor lists.

With considerable help from graphics whiz Nathan Fabian (Sandia), we
added a "dump image"_doc/dump_image.html command with accompanying
options settable via the "dump_modify"_doc/dump_modify.html command.

This enables you to write out a series of high-quality, ray-traced JPG
or PPM images of the collection of sites from lattice-based
applications.  Of course, this does not replace the need for a
full-featured, interactive post-processing visulization capability,
but it does provide a simple, easy way to quickly see how your
simulation is working, since there are numerous tools that can display
individual image files or animate a series of them.  It is also
convenient for very large models, as a replacement for large dump
snapshots.

The "dump image"_doc/dump_image.html doc page includes a couple sample
images you can view.

As part of this command, the previous "dump"_doc/dump.html command now
requires a "style" argument, which can be either "text" or "image".
The previous dump command is now the "text" style.

Fixed some problems with the "group-style
solver"_doc/solve_style.html.  This includes one accuracy bug with the
way changed propensities were assigned to new groups, and some
bookkeeping changes for how zero-valued propensities were handled.
The specified {lo} and {hi} bounds can now be exact matches to event
propensities of your model.  A warning message is printed if generated
propensities violate the specified bounds.

Added an "app_style potts/strain"_doc/app_potts_strain.html
application to model grain growth in the presence of a strain value at
each lattice site.  If SPPARKS is used as a library, then the strain
values can be updated dynamically by another application, such as
"LAMMPS"_lammps, via a driver code.  The LAMMPS distribution includes
an example coupling program that does this, in its "couple" directory.

Fixed a bug in the Schwoebel hop logic in the "app_style
diffusion"_doc/app_diffusion.html command.  Needed to update
propensities one site further away in neighbor list of each site then
we were.  This is 3rd neighbors instead of 2nd neighbors for linear
energies.  And 4th neighbors instead of 3rd neighbors for non-linear
energies.  This should make only a small difference in propensities of
these far-away site, but is important to bookkeep correctly.
