app_style potts/quaternion command :h3

[Syntax:]

app_style style Q crystal theta_cut :pre

style = {potts/quaternion}
Q = number of spin states
crystal = {cubic} or {hcp} 
theta_cut = optional positive cutoff angle (default=15.0) for Read-Shockley energy model :ul

[Examples:]

app_style potts/quaternion 6400 cubic
app_style potts/quaternion 10000 hcp 25.0 :pre

[Description:]

This is an on-lattice application which evolves a Q-state Ising model 
or Potts model, where each lattice site has a spin value from 1 to Q.
Sites flip their spin as the model evolves. 

This Potts variant is designed to incorporate the effects of crystalline
orientation into growth models, allowing more detailed and realistic
simulations of microstructure evolution in Cubic and HCP polycrystals.
Emulating crystalline orientation requires two additions to the standard Potts
model: a choice of a reference crystal symmetry, and calculation of grain
boundary energy based upon relative orientation differences between adjacent
grains/sites.

The Hamiltonian representing the energy of site {i} is as follows:

Hi = (1/2) Sum_j e_ij :pre

where Sum_j is a sum over all the neighbor sites {j} for site {i} and e_{ij} is the
computed bond energy between sites {i} and {j}.  Bond energy between sites {i} and {j} 
is computed using the Read-Shockley relation and the angular disorientation
between sites {i} and {j}. The energy of the entire system is the sum of Hi over
all sites.

The user selects either {cubic} or {hcp} crystal symmetry. To represent crystal
orientation, each site {i} is initialized with a randomly generated unit
quaternion, {qi}. The app calculates the disorientation angle {theta_ij}
between two neighboring sites {i} and {j} using quaternions for the chosen crystal
symmetry.  The disorientation angle {theta_ij} is used to calculate grain
boundary energy and evolve microstructure in exactly the same 
way the potts model is used to simulate grain growth and evolution without 
crystalline orientation. 

More information on the calculation of {theta_ij} can be found in the Mackenzie
and Handscomb papers (citations 1, 2, and 3 below).  Python scripts in
tools/potts_quaternion use the exact header files spparks uses; these python
scripts can be used to verify disorientation distributions for random cubic and
hcp orientations.

The default value for the low-angle cut-off {theta_cut} is 15.0 degrees, a
commonly-used cutoff angle for cubic materials. To specify the low-angle
cut-off different from the default, add the optional input value {theta_cut}.
A maximum disorientation angle exists for each crystal symmetry: 62.7 degrees
for {cubic} and 93.8 degrees for {hcp}. If the user's input {theta_cut} is
greater than these maxima, the simulation will throw an error. A value
{theta_cut=0} is disallowed and does not make sense for the Read-Shockley 
model.

The disorientation angle is used to calculate low-angle grain boundary energies
using the Read-Shockley equation (citation 4). The plot below shows how grain
boundary energy between sites {ij} varies with disorientation angle according
to the Read-Shockley model.
