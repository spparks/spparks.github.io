<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>This is an on-lattice application derived from the <A HREF = "app_potts.html">app_style
potts/neighonly</A> application that simulates the
rastering of a molten pool and its accompanying heat-affected zone
(HAZ) through a domain.  Rastering is achieved through the
specification of layer-by-layer patterns, which can be combined into
an overall pattern specifying the translation of the molten zone
through the entire simulation domain. The application allows for
arbitrary numbers of paths in each layer and an arbitrary number of
layers in each pattern. Thus, the user can construct any scan strategy
desired by specifying individual layer patterns and how these patterns
should be repeated.  Simulating arbitrary paths and layers is often 
used in conjunction with the Stitch IO via the <A HREF = "set.html">set_stitch</A> 
and <A HREF = "dump.html">dump stitch</A> commands.
</P>
<P>The app requires specification of melt pool dimensions <I>width,depth</I>, and
parameters describing the surrounding heat affected zone <I>h0,ht,n</I>.  
The model also requires specification of the melt pool surface via the
<A HREF = "potts_am_bezier.html">potts/am/bezier control_points</A> command.  Whereas <A HREF = "app_am_ellipsoid.html">app_am
ellipsoid</A> uses two ellipsoids to define the moving melt
pool and heat effected zone, here, the molten pool is defined by two fourth
order Bezier curves: 1) top surface curve; 2) spine curve.  The two curves are
combined to form a <I>3D</I> surface representing the interface between liquid and
solidified material.  The shape of the pool is defined by user input control
points for the two curves and may be obtained from laboratory images or through
process simulation or some other means.
</P>
<IMG SRC = "JPG/am_bezier_curves.png">

<P>Degree four Bezier curves require a total of five control points.  However,
symmetry of the melt pool across <I>xz-plane</I> and the bounding top surface plane
<I>z=0</I> reduce the number of required inputs.  Control points for the top surface
curve are input only for half the melt pool on account of symmetry; because the
front and tail of pool start at <I>y=0</I> only three <I>y</I> components of the top
curve are required while the other two components are implicitly set to 0 by
the app.  Similarly, because the spine curve begins and ends at the top surface
<I>z=0</I> only three components of <I>z</I> control points are required.  Both the top
surface curve and spine curve use the same <I>x</I> component values and all five
are required inputs. Melt pool width and depth is explicitly set according to
user inputs <I>width</I>, <I>depth</I> whereas melt pool length is implicitly defined by
the ratio <I>width/length</I> according to the input top surface curve control
points.  The <I>x,y</I> components of the top curve control points are scaled to
achieve the user input pool width.  Similarly, spine curve control point components 
<I>x,z</I> are scaled to specified melt pool depth.  However, the final set of <I>x</I>
components used for both the top surface curve and spine curve are values
obtained from the width scaling operation.  
</P>
<P>The following command defined by this application must be used to
specify the bezier melt pool surface geometry as described above.

<P>During the AM process, polycrystalline grains nucleate and evolve within the
haz.  This makes accurately capturing the haz shape important to microstructure
prediction.  In this model, three parameters <I>h0,ht,n</I> are used to describe the
shape and extent of the haz.  These parameters describe the variable 
heat affected zone that depends upon location relative to the pool surface, 
shown in red below.  The limit of the <I>haz</I> is shown by the blue curve.  <I>h0</I>
and <I>ht</I> are length scale parameters and <I>n</I> is a dimensionless shape factor.
Here, <I>h0</I> represents the size of the haz at the maximum pool width and depth,
while <I>ht</I> indicates the length of the haz at the top surface trailing edge. Together,
these parameters define a position-sensitive and variable haz.
</P>
<IMG SRC = "JPG/variable_haz.png">

<P>Parameters <I>h0,ht</I> are input in spparks lattice units of length and characterize the
heat-affected zone at the edge and trailing edge of the pool. The heat-affected
zone is always present, which means that <I>h0</I> is always greater than zero.
Additionally, <I>ht</I> should be greater than or equal to <I>h0</I>.
</P>
<P>The dimensionless parameter <I>n</I> describes the haz shape.  The value for <I>n</I>
should be greater than <I>3/2</I>; a wide range of possible haz zone shapes are
possible but care should be taken.  A python script is given in the examples
directory and was used to make the plots below for a fixed set of control
points and varying set of haz parameters.  With fixed control points, 
melt pool dimensions are the same.  Different values for the variable haz 
parameters show changes in the resulting heat affected zone.

<P>Some combination of the following additional commands are typically used by this
application to specify a raster pattern.
A layer must be defined by using <A HREF = "am_cartesian_layer.html">am cartesian_layer</A> or 
<A HREF = "am_path_layer.html">am path_layer</A>.  A layer requires one to many <A HREF = "am_path.html">am path</A>

command.

<I>cartesian_layer</I>. 

<LI><A HREF = "am_path.html">am path</A>: Specify arbitrary paths via start/end points
on a layer; sequence of <I>am path</I>s are used to construct an

rectangular layer constructed from <I>am pass</I> and other parameters.

<P>The examples/potts_am_bezier directory has input files which illustrate
use of some of these commands. However these commands 
are not unique to this app and other examples within the examples directory 
may also further illustrate.
